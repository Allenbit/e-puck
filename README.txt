This readme is a guide to the folders in this file.

Compiled_Libraries

This folder contains compiled version of e-puck source code from the e-puck website.

Documentation

This is anything that has ever been dug up about the epuck documentation-wise, 
including the guide from webots, a saved version of the e-puck wiki site, guides to un-bricking the puck, and others.

Guides

The guides were prepared specifically for UNM CS epucks as guides to working with them.

Monitor

This is an interesting program that pairs with the epuck and allows control over it via bluetooth. 

Subversion

A copy of the e-puck source code library (the source version of the Compiled_Libraries folder)

TinyBootloader

A bootloader that theoretically should be able to upload files to the puck if it is configured correctly.  Not really
useful if the MPLAB IDE is available, and I was never really able to get this working.

Tutorial

An epuck tutorial from the internet; I never really had much time to go through this.

Webots

All of the source code I have written for the epuck over the course of the semester, including the two controllers lightFollower
and randomMover.

ZippedFiles

Zipped version of several useful programs.
